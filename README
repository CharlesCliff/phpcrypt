About
=============
phpCrypt is an Open Source PHP Encryption library that does not require
or use the mCrypt or any other PHP extension. It's not as fast
as PHP's mCrypt extention, however if you are in a situation where you
can not use the mCrypt library, phpCrypt is a suitable alternative.

This version of phpCrypt requires PHP 5.3 or later.

Please visit phpCrypt's website for a list of options and constants
used in phpCrypt. phpCrypt's website also lists the required key
sizes for Ciphers, as well as which Modes work with which Ciphers.

All Cipher algorithms were implemented using freely available resources
found online and in books.
