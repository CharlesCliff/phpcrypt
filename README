About
=============
phpCrypt is an encryption library written in PHP from scratch. It aims to
implement all major encryption ciphers, modes, and other tools used for
encryption and decryption. phpCrypt does not rely on mCrypt, other PHP
extenions, or PEAR libraries.

It currently support many popular encryption ciphers. In addition it
supports many popular modes of encryption. There are also tools to implement
the different padding schemes, as well as multiple methods of creating an
Initialization Vecotor (IV) for modes that require one.

phpCrypt is developed by Ryan Gilfether <http://www.gilfether.com/phpcrypt>


Documentation
=============
The phpCrypt website at http://www.gilfether.com/phpcrypt lists much of the
information you need to begin. The phpCrypt website lists all the constants
you need to select ciphers,	modes, padding, and IV methods. In addition,
phpCrypt comes with an `examples` directory which has sample code to help get
you started.

Using phpCrypt is easy to use. An example of encrypting a string using AES-128
with CTR mode is demonstrated below:

	<?php
	include("/path/to/phpcrypt/phpCrypt.php");
	use PHP_Crypt\PHP_Crypt as PHP_Crypt;

	$data = "This is my secret message.";
	$key  = "MySecretKey01234";
	$crypt = new PHP_Crypt($key, PHP_Crypt::CIPHER_AES_128, PHP_Crypt::MODE_CTR);

	$iv = $crypt->createIV();
	$encrypt = $crypt->encrypt($data);

	$crypt->IV($iv);
	$decrypt = $crypt->decrypt($encrypt);
	?>


Generating Random Numbers on Windows
====================================

By default phpCrypt will use the PHP mt_rand() random number generator on
Windows to create an IV. You have the option to use the random number generator
found in the Microsoft CAPICOM SDK which is more secure.

Before this will work you must install the Microsoft CAPICOM SDK and enable the
PHP com_dotnet extension:

	* Download CAPICOM from Microsoft at
	http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=25281

	* Double click the MSI file you downloaded, and follow the install directions

	* Open a command prompt and register the DLL:
	regsvr32 C:\Program Files\PATH TO\CAPICOM SDK\Lib\X86\capicom.dll

	* Now edit php.ini to enable the com_dotnet extension:
	extension=php_com_dotnet.dll

	* If you are running PHP as an Apache module, restart Apache.

To use the Windows random number generator in CAPICOM you would call creatIV() like so:

	$iv = $crypt->createIV(PHP_Crypt::IV_WIN_COM);
