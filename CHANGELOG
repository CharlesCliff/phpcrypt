2013-07-18  phpCrypt-0.3.1  Ryan Gilfether

	* Found a major bug in the way IV's are used in Encryption
	and Decryption. The $iv parameter has been removed from
	phpCrypt::Encrypt() and phpCrypt::Decrypt() function, and
	instead the IV should be set with phpCrypt::setIV()

	* Updated the code in the 'examples' directory to reflect
	the changes made to correct the IV bug

	* Updated README and README.md to reflect the changes made
	for the IV bug

2013-07-12  phpCrypt-0.3  Ryan Gilfether

	* Added the Blowfish Cipher

	* Updated CryptBase::decimal2Hex() with a parameter to force
	the returned hex to specified byte size

	* Updated RC2.php to use the uInt() function

	* Added phpCrypt::SetIV() function

	* Removed the $iv parameter from phpCrypt::CreateIV(),
	now to set the IV use the phpCrypt::SetIV() function,
	or pass the IV in the encrypt() or decrypt() function

	* Renamed CryptBase.php to Base.php. Removed it as a parent
	class to all other classes except the Cipher class, as it
	was the only class that really needed it.

	* General performance improvements

2013-06-28  phpCrypt-0.2  Ryan Gilfether

	* Fixed Enigma so that it works on both 64 and 32 bit platforms

	* Renamed & fixed the following functions in CryptBase.php
	to use native PHP function calls:
	uInt(), sInt(), uInt32(), sInt32(), uChar(), sChar()

2013-06-24  phpCrypt-0.1  Ryan Gilfether

	* The initial release of phpCrypt 0.1
