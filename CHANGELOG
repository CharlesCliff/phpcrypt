2013-07-21  phpCrypt-0.4  Ryan Gilfether

	* Added the 3-Way cipher. phpCrypt's implementation is
	compatible with mCrypts implementation, though there may
	be a bug in mCrypt's 3-Way gamma() function. phpCrypt
	mimics the bug to make it compatible, if it is a bug.
	Unfortunately I do no know enough about 3-Way nor could
	I find much information on it to know if the gamma() function
	is suppose to behave the way it does. Please read phpCrypt's
	3Way::gamma() function comment for further information.

	* Windows users now have the option to create an IV using
	the secure random number generator found in the Microsoft
	CAPICOM SDK. The new constant is PHP_Crypt::IV_WIN_COM.
	View the README file for more information.

	* Fixed a bug in CTR mode where the last few bytes may
	not get passed to the cipher in some cases

	* Mode::CreateIV() now hashes the random string of bytes
	before returning it as the IV. This helps in the adding
	additional 'randomness' to the IV

	* Bug fixes and minor speed improvements in some of the
	modes.

	* Updated all functions and calculations to handle block
	size in bytes instead of bits. This makes the API less
	confusing and fewer conversions from bits to bytes.

2013-07-19  phpCrypt-0.3.2  Ryan Gilfether

	* Version 0.3.1 contained some incomplete files and bugs
	which were not fixed before the release. This version
	addresses those issues.

	* Fixes in the examples code

	* Removed the phpCrypt::setIV() function and renamed to
	phpCrypt::IV()

2013-07-18  phpCrypt-0.3.1  Ryan Gilfether

	* Found a major bug in the way IV's are used in Encryption
	and Decryption. The $iv parameter has been removed from
	phpCrypt::Encrypt() and phpCrypt::Decrypt() function, and
	instead the IV should be set with phpCrypt::setIV()

	* Updated the code in the 'examples' directory to reflect
	the changes made to correct the IV bug

	* Updated README and README.md to reflect the changes made
	for the IV bug

2013-07-12  phpCrypt-0.3  Ryan Gilfether

	* Added the Blowfish Cipher

	* Updated CryptBase::decimal2Hex() with a parameter to force
	the returned hex to specified byte size

	* Updated RC2.php to use the uInt() function

	* Added phpCrypt::SetIV() function

	* Removed the $iv parameter from phpCrypt::CreateIV(),
	now to set the IV use the phpCrypt::SetIV() function,
	or pass the IV in the encrypt() or decrypt() function

	* Renamed CryptBase.php to Base.php. Removed it as a parent
	class to all other classes except the Cipher class, as it
	was the only class that really needed it.

	* General performance improvements

2013-06-28  phpCrypt-0.2  Ryan Gilfether

	* Fixed Enigma so that it works on both 64 and 32 bit platforms

	* Renamed & fixed the following functions in CryptBase.php
	to use native PHP function calls:
	uInt(), sInt(), uInt32(), sInt32(), uChar(), sChar()

2013-06-24  phpCrypt-0.1  Ryan Gilfether

	* The initial release of phpCrypt 0.1
